AI powered Computer Vision that lives on the Edge
======================================================

Empower your product with our pre-trained models.
Our technology is engineered to work on Linux computers.
We believe that privacy matters even in the 21st century, and therefore all processing happens on the device locally, and not a cloud.



We currently offer three modules included in the Mobius Vision SDK and our On Premise software:

* Keywording module: Tag images with more than 5000 general keywords
* Aesthetics module: Estimate image aesthetics (based on professional curators' style)
* Customization module: Add custom keywords and/or style allowing everyone to retrain our models to fit to specific needs
