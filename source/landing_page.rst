About Mobius Vision SDK
==========================

AI powered Computer Vision that lives on the Edge
--------------------------------------------------

New documentation is available on https://docs.mobius.ml/on_premise/latest.

Mobius Labs provides next-generation Computer Vision technology for edge devices and on-premise solutions. 

Use this on-premise SDK to train custom concepts or styles, build libraries, and create solutions that are 100% your own intellectual property.
We believe that privacy matters even in the 21st century, and therefore all processing happens on the device locally, and not somewhere on cloud servers.

Mobius Vision SDK is broadly split into |mobvis_image| and |mobvis_video|.

|mobvis_image| currently contains the following modules:

* Tags module: Tag images with nearly 10000 standard concepts
* Aesthetics module: Estimate image aesthetics (based on data from professional curators)
* Customization module: Add custom concepts and/or styles allowing everyone to retrain our models to fit to specific needs
* Similarity Search: Find similar looking images by providing a reference image

|mobvis_video| currently contains the following modules:

* Video shot detection module: Identify sequences of frames with the same semantical content
* Video tags module: Tag videos with nearly 10000 standard concepts, on different levels of granularity
* Video highlights module: Score the shots of a video to identify the highlights.
