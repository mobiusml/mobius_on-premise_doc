About Mobius Vision SDK
==========================

AI powered Computer Vision that lives on the Edge
--------------------------------------------------

Empower your product with our pre-trained models.
Our technology is engineered to work on Linux computers.
We believe that privacy matters even in the 21st century, and therefore all processing happens on the device locally, and not a cloud.
