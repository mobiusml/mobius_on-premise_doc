Advanced: Similarity Search
=================================

Overview and work flow
------------------------
Mobius Vision SDK provides a powerful similarity search that can be run in just a few steps.
Please note that there is a difference between the very first usage ("initial phase"), and the usage of similarity search in a running system ("adding samples").
We provide examples for both cases. In the initial phase, the system is trained on all images that are in the image database.
When one wants to extend the image database of a running system with new samples, only the added images are analyzed; in addition, the indices of all images are updated. This prevents the computationally heavy training procedure to be carried out again on images that have already been added to the image database.

Initial phase:

#. Adding samples
#. Index training
#. Search with query image

Extending the image database of a running system:

#. Adding sample(s)
#. Updating index/indices
#. Search with query image

The following illustration shows a simplified view of how the similarity search works.

Adding samples
--------------

The first step is to add images to the docker volume by sending a POST request to the following endpoint:
::

  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/add?id=<unique_id> -X POST -F "data=@./your_img.jpg"

where id is an optional argument. Without this argument, the system will generate a random ID number and return it as a response.

.. note::

  The ID numbers for image samples should be unique, since they are used internally to identify the images. We recommend either using numbers, or a combination of numbers and letters. They should be passed as a string.

You can also add samples using the following python script:
::

  def add_sample(img_path, ID):
    with open(img_path, 'rb') as image:
        data = {'data': image}
        r = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/add?id=%s' % ID, files=data).json()
    return r

The SDK then processes the added images by extraxting numerical features according to our pre-trained Mobius keywording model. All processed samples are stored in an auxiliary structure we call an "index".

.. warning::

  This step is computationally expensive. If the number of images is very large (e.g., more than 1 million), it may take more than one day to process all images on a single GPU.

Index Training
------------

For the similarity search, the numerical features extracted in the last step have to be further processed. This so-called "index training" enables fast search and adaptation to the provided image data.

To run index training, send GET request to the following endpoint:
::

  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/train

.. note::

  For a successful index training, you should add at least 1 000 images. However, we recommend to use at least 100 000 images.

The request will return a json file with the field task_id. The following command shows how the task_id can be used to get the status of the training:
::

  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/status/<task_id>

The following error messages could appear:

* *'need more samples'*: the number of samples is less than 1 000
* *'no samples'*: no samples have been added for training
* *'no index, train first'*: update function can only be called after one training has been carried out

.. note::

  Although this process is quite fast, it may take several hours to process all images for large image collections.

Search
------

After image samples have been added to the docker volume, as well as all samples have been indexed and trained on, the search function can be used.

Similarity search with a query image can be used with the following endpoint:
::

  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/search -X POST -F "data=@./your_query_img.jpg"


Or using this call from a python script:
::

  def search(img_path):
      with open(img_path, 'rb') as image:
          data = {'data': image}
          r = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/search', files=data).json()
      return r

.. note::

  This search call is very fast and should generally run in less than 1 second.

The output is split into three parts:

* A list of distances in floating point precision that quanifies the similarity of similar images found. Since the lower distance implies higher similarity, this list is sorted in ascending order.
* A list of image IDs (as added to the index) of the most similar images, sorted the same way as the first list.
* A status message, which says 'ok' if no error occurred in the search, and 'error' otherwise.


Example of an output
::

  {
      'dist': [349.9123229980469, 363.0243835449219, 501.1552734375, 519.2177734375, 576.5772705078125, 663.9130859375, 667.498291015625, 671.4913940429688, 684.84228515625, 705.6535034179688],
      'result': ['1260', '140', '1267', '1685', '866', '1173', '583', '105', '4', '154'],
      'status': u'ok'
  }

In the example, the image with ID 1260 is the most similar to the query image provided, with a distance of 349.912.

You can control the number of similar images returned by the environment variable SIMILARITY_SEARCH_NUM_RESULTS (use -e option for docker). The default value is set to 10.

.. note::

  You can use the environment variable NPROB to balance between speed and accuracy. Its value has to be an integer between 1 and 100 (smaller value means faster search, with less accurate results). The recommended (default) value is 5.

Updating
------------

It might be desired to add more images to the image database in a running system. In this case, one can use the update function that preserves previously added images in the index, and adds the new images without retraining the images that are already in the image database.

.. note::

  Before the update function can be run, images have to be added to the docker volume (see Adding samples).

Once all the desired images have been added, one has to update the index. This can be done by sending a GET request to the following endpoint.
::

  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/update

The request above returns a json file with a task_id, which can be used to get status of updating process:
::

  curl 127.0.0.1:5000/similarity/status/<task_id>

.. warning::

  This step is computationally expensive. If the number of images is very large (e.g., more than 1 million), it may take several hours to process all images on a single GPU.

Once the updating is complete, the similarity search will be performed on all images of the extended image database.
